Consider the following cryptarithmetic puzzle. Every letter corresponds to exactly one digit. In particular, the digits corresponding to different letters are different. Furthermore, $A$ and $G$ should not be $0$, and $W$ must be greater than $I$.

\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
    \item Describe the corresponding CSP with its variables and constraints and specify the initial domain of each variable.
    \item Draw the constraint graph.
    \item Find a solution of the puzzle. How many unique soltuions exist? You may use automated solvers or program your own, but be sure that you can explain how a solution could be found by hand.
