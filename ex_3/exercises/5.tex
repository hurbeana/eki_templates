Assume there is a lottery with tickets for €$5$ and there are three possible prizes: €$1000$ with a probability of €$0.05\%$, €$100$ with probability $0.1\%,$ and €$1$ otherwise.

\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
    \item What is the expected monetary value of a lottery ticket?
    \item  When is it rational to buy a ticket? Give an inequality involving utilities with the following utilities: $U(S_k) = 0, U(S_{k+5} ) = 5 \cdot U(S_{k+1} ), U(S_{k+100}) = 50 \cdot U(S_{k+5}),$ but there is no information about $U(S_{k+1000})$.
    \item  Define $U(S_{k+5})$ and $U(S_{k+1000})$ such that a rational agent whose utility function satisfies the equations in Subtask (b) chooses to buy a lottery ticket.
\end{enumerate}
